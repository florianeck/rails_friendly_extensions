# rails_friendly_extensions

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/florianeck/rails_friendly_extensions.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/florianeck/rails_friendly_extensions)

This is my personal, useful lib to extend Rails basic methods for String, Date, Number, Hash and serveral other classes just for easy use... 

All in all, my first github project, trying to make some moves on new grounds or so... Just did it because i need this stuff, and some other 
code i wrote in the last three years, for serveral projects, so its just comfortable for for me to use it as a 'shared component'

What ever, maybe it will be useful to someone,  neither its test-covered nor checked any other way. so use it at ur own risk.

Up in here we have following tools: (just some examples for the best features, try the rest on ur own, it's all experimential, but's 
yet kinda useful to me, so feel free to check out;-):

To get an idea of what this plugin provides, you can easyli generate the documentation with the `rdoc` command. Also the lib folder contains all methods ordered by the class which is extended.
Most of the features are tested as well.
